# Flutter Ghouls: Minting NFTs Directly from Android 
Flutter Ghouls is a mobile application built with Flutter, to empower creators and artists to mint their unique digital artworks as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) directly from their Android smartphones, without the need for a desktop or web interface.

To run this app, you need a Moralis and nft.storage account. The solidity smart contract is a standard ERC 721 openzepplin wizard contract. Have fun!
